# This file can be used directly by 'phd', see 'build-all.sh' in this
# directory for how it can be invoked.  The only requirement is a list
# of nodes you'd like it to modify.
#
# The scope of each command-block is controlled by the preceeding
# 'target' line. 
#
# - target=all
#   The commands are executed on evey node provided
#
# - target=local
#   The commands are executed from the node hosting phd. When not
#   using phd, they should be run from some other independant host
#   (such as the puppet master)
#
# - target=$PHD_ENV_nodes{N}
#   The commands are executed on the Nth node provided.
#   For example, to run on only the first node would be target=$PHD_ENV_nodes1
#
# Tasks to be performed at this step include:
